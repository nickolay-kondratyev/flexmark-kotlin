From one perspective we don't need PDF converter yet and it could simplify the transition. 

Also, we can always bring the PDF converter later as a module without increasing the cost right now.

This is crucial point, if the cost of doing it later is comparable to doing it now, then we should do it later.

That means we slim down the problematic modules now, and focus on the core functionality for migration.

We can always follow up with configuring the other modules in the future to be a part of this as well.
