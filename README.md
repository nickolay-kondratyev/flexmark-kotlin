This is a fork from https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java.

GOAL of Fork: attempt to convert the core of the flexmark from java to **Kotlin** and decouple from JVM specific libraries.

Why? So that core of flexmark can be used in kotlin-multiplatform projects.

For original README refer to [ORIGINAL_FLEXMARK_README.md](./ORIGINAL_FLEXMARK_README.md)
